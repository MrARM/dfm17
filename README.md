# DFM-17 Custom code, WIP!
This is a bare project, I'm working on trying to also familliarize myself with developing using the STM32 generated code. 

In the initial commit, it will build but I've been working on trying to port the Si4063 code from https://github.com/TomasTT7/TT7D-Tracker/ which isn't complete. Remove those files to get it to build.
